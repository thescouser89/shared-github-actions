# Introduction

This repository is used to store GitHub Action workflows (and other stuff) that we'll re-use in other PNC repositories

These workflows are designed for Maven-based Java projects and can be included
in other repositories using the `workflow_call` mechanism.

# Available Workflows

## Maven CI (`maven-ci.yml`)
Standard Continuous Integration workflow for Maven projects that we use to test
PRs. For some of the workflows, we can also further customize it by specifying
the Java version etc.

- **Tasks**: Checkout code, set up Java (default: 21), run build command (`mvn
  clean install`), and check for code formatting errors.


## Maven Release (`maven-release.yml`)
Workflow for performing a release to Maven Central (Sonatype).

- **Tasks**: Configures Git, sets up Java and GPG, performs `release:prepare`
  and `release:perform`, and pushes changes/tags back to the repository. The
  next version is set by bumping the patch version by 1 and putting the
  `-SNAPSHOT` suffix.


## Maven Snapshot (`maven-snapshot.yml`)
Workflow for deploying snapshot versions to Maven Central.

- **Tasks**: Deploy our SNAPSHOT version of our project to Maven Central
  Optionally builds and pushes a Quarkus Jib image to Quay.io.


## Maven Set Version (`maven-set-version.yml`)
Workflow to update the version in a Maven `pom.xml`.

- **Tasks**: Updates the version using `versions:set` and commits/pushes the change.
 
This workflow should be manually called and an example of that may be seen [here](https://github.com/project-ncl/environment-driver/blob/main/.github/workflows/maven-set-version.yml). Its recommended that `on.workflow_dispatch` is used so the user can enter the appropriate values e.g.
```
on:
  workflow_dispatch: # Manual trigger
    inputs:
      new_version:
        description: '[Required] Version to set'
        required: true
        type: string
...
jobs:
    call-maven-set-version-job:
      permissions:
        contents: write # needed to push commit and tag back to the repository
      uses: project-ncl/shared-github-actions/.github/workflows/maven-set-version.yml@504efc82df7d4f73e3bd2b67bec31bcd532ed9e4 # v0.0.14
      with:
        new_version: ${{ inputs.new_version }}
```


## Maven Jib (`maven-jib.yml`)
*Work in Progress* workflow to build Jib images and upload to a container
registry.


## Validate GitHub Action (`validate-gh-action.yml`)
Workflow used to lint and validate GitHub Actions using `actionlint` and
`zizmor`. This is used in this repository's `validate.yml` to run for PRs.

## Usage Example

To use one of these workflows in your repository, add a new workflow file
(e.g., `.github/workflows/ci.yml`) and reference the shared workflow:

```yaml
name: Run PR test

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ * ]

jobs:
  build:
    uses: project-ncl/shared-github-actions/.github/workflows/maven-ci.yml@<sha> # <tag>
    with:
      # if you want to customize the java_version
      java_version: '17'
```

A Github repository example using those workflows can be found
(here)[https://github.com/project-ncl/environment-driver/tree/main/.github/workflows]

# Misc

## Dependabot

A sample dependabot file in `.github/dependabot.yml` is available that is both used in this repository and may be copied to other ProjectNCL repositories.

## GitHub Releases
A sample `.github/release.yml` configuration file from the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/automatically-generated-release-notes#configuring-automatically-generated-release-notes) has been added that may be copied to other ProjectNCL repositories.

## Github Action validations
We use (zizmor)[https://docs.zizmor.sh/] and
[actionlint](https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint) to validate that our Github
Actions are secure.

One of the requirements is to explicitly define a permissions key to specify
the level of access that the injected `GITHUB_TOKEN` should have.

For workflows that do not require to `git push` any changes, we set an empty
permissions field:
```
permissions: {}
```

and for those that do:
```
permissions:
  contents: write
```
For example, `maven-release.yml` requires to `git push` changes back to the
repository and needs those permissions.

Note that the final workflow should also specify the same permissions as the
shared workflow being used.
